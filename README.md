# firewall-penitentiary: A game by Daniel Day, Jamie Leask, Thomas Murphy and Matthew Sullivan
It is the year 2103CE and the planet now stands on the brink of overpopulation.  To save on space and reduce overhead, convicted criminals are now hard wired into 'on-line virtual prisons,' computer simulations in which their brains interface directly with server while their bodies are kept healthy but paralyzed until they have served out their sentence.  In some cases, especially where criminals with a more violent history are concerned, their antics are broadcast on the media bands as a form of entertainment.  A modern cybersport, if you will.  A fraction of the proceeds help fund the ailing justice system but the majority serve to line the pockets of investors and CEOs. 

Our story focuses on the fate of one such 'virtual prison,' Firewall 5 Penitentiary, and its inhabitants.  The guards are underpaid, the inmates restless, the server is badly outdated and needs maintenance but the necessary funds simply aren't available.  As a result, security focuses on the more important areas of the network, leaving older, less vital systems vulnerable to the actions of anyone who happens upon them.  More and more prisoners are slipping through the cracks and escaping into the vastness of the internet.
